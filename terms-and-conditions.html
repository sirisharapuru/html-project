Therewith, from the moment of the duly fulfillment of the Repurchase Obligation, the request for the payment of Contractual interest on arrears related to the Claim shall also be assigned back to the Invoice Seller, excl. the Contractual interest on arrears that the Buyer has already managed to pay to the Portal Operator as well as the representative of Investor(s).</p>

						<p>10.3.
